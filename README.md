# 1KVA-SINE-WAVE-POWER-INVERTER
This is a design of a sine wave power inverter, which can be used in your homes and offices.

IN the design the Inverter converts 12v/24v to 220volts.

# SECTIONS OF THE DESIGN
- Power Section : This consist of the battery portion, here we used 12v acid battery to power it on.
- Oscillator : This is the part that the frequency and signals are  being generation to feed to the MOSFET.
- Booster : This involves the mosfet switching the signal state and giving to the transmorfer.
- Output : Here the transformer gives an output of 220volts.
